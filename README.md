# fake1910NewsHeadlines
 Project for the  Data Jam for Newspaper Navigator library of congress.
 
We choose a year in which a world tragedy happened. We select headlines related to that tragey and train an algorithm to learn to create fake headlines using the style and prhases of that year. The algorithm takes an user generated phrase negating the tragedy and completes it as if those tragedies didn't occur.
